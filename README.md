### Full setup

Some reveal.js features, like external markdown, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)

4. Clone the reveal.js repository
```
$ git clone git@github.com:hakimel/reveal.js.git
```

5. Navigate to the reveal.js folder
```
$ cd reveal.js
```

6. Install dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

7. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
```
$ grunt serve
```

8. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation
